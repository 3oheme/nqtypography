<p>Hi guys!</p>

<p>This site is <strong>Northern Quarter Typography</strong>, a tribute page to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Quarter_(Manchester)" title="Link to Northern Quarter Wikipedia page">Northen Quarter area</a> in Manchester (United Kingdom), one of the most vibrant, modern and bohemian areas, even part of the tentative list of nominated sites for UNESCO World Heritage Site Status.</p>

<p>And typography, as usual, does a great job reflecting society, people and mood, as you can enjoy in these pictures of handwritten pieces of art, precise computer-created posters or impressive signboards and posters.</p>
